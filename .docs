- wee_alloc is a memory allocator designed for WebAssembly. It generates less than a kilobyte of
  uncompressed WebAssembly code.

- UnorderedMap is a data structure that utilizes underlying blockchain trie storage more efficiently

- #[] is a declarative tag

- Self refers to the current type, which is KeyValue.

- While creating a new unordered map, we must pass the ID as Vec<u8> type so we are converting b"r" which is a byte string, to Vec<u8>, using the to_vec() function.
